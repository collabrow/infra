# AWS CDK PostgreSQL App - Project Summary

## What We Built

A complete AWS CDK application that deploys a production-ready PostgreSQL database on AWS using:

### Core Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL RDS Instance**: Running PostgreSQL 15.4 with automated backups, encryption, and monitoring
- **Custom VPC**: Multi-AZ setup with public, private, and isolated subnets for security
- **Security Groups**: Properly configured with least-privilege access
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Automated credential management
- **Bastion Host**: Secure access to the database
- **Parameter Groups**: Custom PostgreSQL configuration with logging and monitoring

### Package Manager Configuration
- **pnpm**: Configured as the primary package manager instead of npm
- **Performance**: Faster installs and better dependency management
- **Disk Space**: More efficient storage with symlinked dependencies

## Key Features

### Security
✅ Database in isolated subnets (no internet access)
✅ Encrypted storage
✅ Automated credential rotation via Secrets Manager
✅ Security groups with minimal required access
✅ Bastion host for secure database access

### Monitoring & Observability
✅ Performance Insights enabled
✅ CloudWatch metrics and logs
✅ Enhanced monitoring (60-second granularity)
✅ Query logging and performance tracking

### High Availability & Backup
✅ Multi-AZ deployment option (configurable)
✅ Automated backups with 7-day retention
✅ Point-in-time recovery
✅ Deletion protection (configurable)

### Cost Optimization
✅ t3.micro instance for development (easily scalable)
✅ Single NAT Gateway to reduce costs
✅ GP2 storage with right-sizing

## Commands (pnpm)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Generate CloudFormation template
pnpm run synth

# Deploy to AWS
pnpm run deploy

# Show differences before deployment
pnpm run diff

# Destroy the stack
pnpm run destroy
```

## Deployment Outputs

After deployment, you'll receive:
- Database endpoint and port
- Database credentials secret ARN
- VPC ID
- Bastion host instance ID and public IP

## Production Readiness

The stack is designed with production considerations:
- **Security**: Defense in depth with VPC isolation and security groups
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
- **Backup**: Automated backup and recovery
- **Scalability**: Easy to modify instance types and storage
- **Cost Management**: Optimized for development with production upgrade path

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run `pnpm run deploy` to create the infrastructure
2. **Connect**: Use the bastion host to securely access PostgreSQL
3. **Monitor**: Use CloudWatch and Performance Insights for monitoring
4. **Scale**: Modify instance types and storage as needed
5. **Secure**: Consider enabling Multi-AZ and increasing backup retention for production

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests that verify:
- RDS instance creation with correct configuration
- VPC and security group setup
- Secrets Manager integration
- Bastion host deployment
- All required stack outputs

All tests pass successfully with Jest.
